# Thoth.Json Decoder Examples

## Notes

* Almost all of the examples are taken from the module Tests.Decoders from the file [Decoders.fs](https://github.com/thoth-org/Thoth.Json/blob/master/tests/Decoders.fs)

* For simplicity's sake, examples are output directly to the Browser DOM, without using frameworks such as React or Elmish.
