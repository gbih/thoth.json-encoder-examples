# Thoth.Json Encoder Examples

## Notes

-   Almost all of the examples are taken from the module Tests.Encoders from the file [Encoders.fs](https://github.com/thoth-org/Thoth.Json/blob/master/tests/Encoders.fs)

-   For simplicity's sake, examples are output directly to the Browser DOM, without using frameworks such as React or Elmish.
